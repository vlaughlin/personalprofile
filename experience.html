        <h2>Experience</h2>
        
       <p> During my younger years, I started to learn how to create websites with the help of WYSIWYG editors. Then I gained interest in learning the science behind the World Wide Web because I wanted to have the freedom of customizing my personal websites. I learned basic HTML,CSS, and Javascript concepts through online resources. During 2000 there was no such thing as Wordpress so I learned how to install Greymatter into a website directory and how to customize it. Greymatter is known as the original open source weblogging software at the time but later got replaced by Wordpress a few years later which I am currently learning now.</p>

<p>Then as the time went by I learned a little bit of graphic design with the help of online tutorials. Now I am currently enrolled in an online tech degree and I am very excited about keeping myself up to date with all latest advances and trends that I have missed during the past years. After I finish my degree I want to create good content for clients that are in need of an interactive web presence.
